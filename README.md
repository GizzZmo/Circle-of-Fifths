## About

The Circle of Fifths Tool is designed to help musicians, composers, and music students understand the relationships between different musical keys. This tool provides an interactive and visual way to explore key signatures, chord progressions, and harmonic relationships.

## What is the Circle of Fifths?

The Circle of Fifths is a fundamental concept in music theory that illustrates the relationships among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys. Moving clockwise around the circle, each key is a perfect fifth higher than the previous one. Moving counterclockwise, each key is a perfect fifth lower (or a perfect fourth higher).

### Key Benefits:

- **Understand Key Signatures**: Quickly determine how many sharps or flats are in any key
- **Find Relative Keys**: Easily identify major and minor keys that share the same key signature
- **Compose Chord Progressions**: Discover harmonically related chords for smooth transitions
- **Transpose Music**: Navigate between keys efficiently
- **Learn Music Theory**: Visual representation makes complex relationships intuitive

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore the circle of fifths in an intuitive interface
- **Key Signature Reference**: View sharps and flats for all major and minor keys
- **Chord Relationships**: Understand which chords work well together
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for music students and teachers
- **Quick Reference**: Fast lookup for composers and arrangers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

(To be added based on implementation)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GizzZmo/Circle-of-Fifths-.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Circle-of-Fifths-

# Additional setup steps will be added as the project develops
```

## Usage

(Usage instructions will be added as features are implemented)

### Basic Example

The Circle of Fifths tool helps you:

1. **Find Key Signatures**: Select a key to see its sharps or flats
2. **Navigate Keys**: Move clockwise (+5th) or counterclockwise (-5th) between keys
3. **Discover Relationships**: See which keys are closely related for modulation

### Common Use Cases

- **Songwriting**: Find keys that work well together for key changes
- **Practice**: Plan your practice routine by working through the circle
- **Analysis**: Analyze harmonic progressions in existing music
- **Ear Training**: Develop your ability to recognize key relationships by ear

## Music Theory Background

### The Structure

The Circle of Fifths organizes all 12 chromatic pitches in a circle, where:

- **Clockwise movement**: Each step moves up by a perfect fifth (7 semitones)
- **Counterclockwise movement**: Each step moves down by a perfect fifth (up by a perfect fourth)

### Key Signatures

- **Sharp Keys** (Clockwise from C): G, D, A, E, B, F♯, C♯
  - Each key adds one sharp in the order: F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯, A♯, E♯, B♯
  
- **Flat Keys** (Counterclockwise from C): F, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭
  - Each key adds one flat in the order: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭, F♭

### Relative Major and Minor

Every major key has a relative minor key that shares the same key signature:
- The relative minor is located 3 semitones (a minor third) below its relative major
- Example: C major and A minor both have no sharps or flats

### Closely Related Keys

Keys adjacent to each other on the circle (one step away) share all but one note and are considered closely related:
- They differ by only one sharp or flat
- Modulations between these keys sound smooth and natural
- Example: C major (no sharps/flats) is closely related to G major (1 sharp) and F major (1 flat)
